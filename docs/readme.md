# Development notes 

This is where we're reviewing and editing the docs for feedland.com. 

### Where stuff is

The pages are stored in the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/a8c-FeedLand-Support/tree/main/docs">docs folder</a> on the A8C-FeedLand-Support repo. 

This is the <a href="https://docs.feedland.dev/">docs website</a>, which simply mirrors the docs folder, rendered through a template. I would recommend reading it there. 

There's a command in the menu that takes you to the GitHub source for the page you're reading.  

You can <a href="https://github.com/scripting/a8c-FeedLand-Support/issues">report problems</a> by posting an issue, or post a pull request.

### Notes

The docs website is at a temporary URL. When it's ready to be linked into the product it'll be at docs.feedland.com.

Here's the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/code/feedland/docs/markdowntemplate.txt">template</a> it uses. 

I edit the whole site in a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/a8c-FeedLand-Support/blob/main/docs/source.opml">single outline.
