# FeedLand Docs 

This is where we're reviewing and editing the docs for the A8C release of FeedLand. 

### How to read

There's a menu at the top of each page that lists the docs. Just choose a page, and off you go. 

If you want to visit the GitHub source for the page you're reading choose <i>On GitHub,</i> the last command in the menu. 

### Caveats

* This repo is private for now, while we get it together. 

* Be aware that anything you post here will be public soon. 

### Where stuff is

* The pages are stored in the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/a8c-FeedLand-Support/tree/main/docs">docs folder</a> on the A8C-FeedLand-Support repo. 

* This is the <a href="https://docs.feedland.dev/">docs website</a>, which simply mirrors the docs folder, rendered through a template. I would recommend reading it there. There's a command in the menu that takes you to the GitHub source for the page you're reading. 

* You can <a href="https://github.com/scripting/a8c-FeedLand-Support/issues">report problems</a> by posting an issue, or post a pull request.

### Notes

* The docs website is at a temporary URL. I'm hosting it, but expect it to eventually be hosted on an Automattic server. The server is configured to serve out of the docs folder. 

* When changes are merged, they are instantly available on the website.

* Here's the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/code/feedland/docs/markdowntemplate.txt">template</a> it uses. (I will move this into the repo too.) 

* I designed this flow guessing this is fairly close to the way A8C manages its docs.

* I edit the whole site in a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/a8c-FeedLand-Support/blob/main/docs/source.opml">single outline</a> in an ancient piece of software known as UserLand Frontier.
