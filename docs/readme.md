# FeedLand Docs 

This is where we're reviewing and editing the docs for the A8C release of FeedLand. 

### Caveats

* This repo is private for now, while we get it together. 

* I don't want it to be private for very long. 

* Be aware that anything you post here will be public. 

### Where stuff is

* The pages are stored in the docs folder here on the A8C-FeedLand-Support repo. 

* This is the <a href="https://docs.feedland.dev/">docs website</a>, which simply mirrors the docs folder, rendered through a template. 

* You can <a href="https://github.com/scripting/a8c-FeedLand-Support/issues">report problems</a> by posting an issue, or post a pull request.

### Updates

* The pages have been converted to Markdown from HTML.  

* The docs website is at a temporary URL. I'm hosting it, but expect it to eventually be hosted on an Automattic server. The server is configured to serve out of the docs folder. 

* When changes are merged, they are instantly available on the website.

* Here's the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/code/feedland/docswebsite/markdowntemplate.txt">template</a> it uses. (I will move this into the repo too.) 

* I designed this flow guessing this is fairly close to the way A8C manages its docs.

* I edit the whole site in a single outline in Electric Drummer using a tool called Glorp. 

* The outline will be stored in the repo too.

This is just a test to see if the CMS is working.

All the non-developer docs are reviewed and in the new Markdown-based format. 

To see the list, look through the menu, at the top of the page.   

Soon they will be in the repo, had to change the way the text flowed, posting directly to GitHub has once again proved not dependable, though more problems were fixed this time around. Eventually we'll get this working properly.
