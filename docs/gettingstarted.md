# Getting started with FeedLand  

### What is FeedLand

FeedLand is a web service for managing lists of feeds, sharing them with other users, both in and outside of FeedLand, and reading and sharing news. 

The goal of FeedLand is to make news a social thing, following the pattern of social media apps, but using open formats and protocols.

So FeedLand is feeds, news and people and software that connects it all together.

### Community

People subscribe to feeds, we squeeze news out of feeds, and shape it into products. 

People can add new feeds. There's a limit of 250 new feeds for each user.  

You can also subscribe to feeds other people have added. No limit there. Subscribe to as many as you like.

Everyone can see everything. Our lists and categories are there for everyone to use. 

A FeedLand community works together shaping news flows.

### The 250-feed limit

There's a limit of 250 new feeds per user. 

A new feed is one that no one else is subscribed to. So if you're clicking a checkbox in someone else's feed list, that won't count against your 250 feed limit. 

At some point we will provide a way to purchase more subscriptions if you run up against the limit. 

### Nothing is hidden

Something important about FeedLand. Almost everything is open to everyone. I can see your feed list and you can see mine. I can read the news as you see it and vice versa.  

Obviously only you can sign in as you, that much is secret, as are your settings. 

You can only subscribe to feeds if you're signed in.

### How to sign up

If this is your first time using FeedLand, you'll need to create a new account. 

1. Go to <a href="https://feedland.com/">feedland.com</a>.

2. You should see a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/30/feedlandSignonDialog.png">dialog</a> where you can log in using WordPress. 

3. We also have a way to sign up with just an email address. Instructions for that are coming soon. 

After logging in, you're offered a chance to add some feeds to your empty feed list. It's easier to learn the product with a few feeds you're subscribed to. After they're added you will be taken to your Feed List page. 

### Reading the news

To read news from the feeds you're subscribed to, choose <i>My News</i> from the main menu.

This is the primary way to read news in FeedLand. 

### Finding feeds

Choose <a href="https://feedland.org/?userslist">Recent users</a> from the first menu. Click on a name to see what they're subscribed to.  

If you see a feed you want to subscribe to, click the <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/10/20/134911.html?title=someoneElsesFeedList">checkbox</a>. That's all you have to do.

Another way to find feeds is to look in the <a href="http://feedland.org/?hotlist">Hotlist</a> or the <a href="http://feedland.org/?log">Subscription log</a>, accessible from the first menu. 

To get back to your feed list, choose <i>My feed list</i> from the first menu.
