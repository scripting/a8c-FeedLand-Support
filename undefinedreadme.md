# FeedLand Docs 

The docs are being updated here, bringing them current, and using them to review the functionality of the product looking for things that need attention. 

For a list of all the docs currently available, <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1686843/258141641-ca25e468-0fbb-4d5f-bb39-96e3c873a127.png">look in the Docs menu</a> at the top of each page. 

The docs are rendered from my Glorp outline directly to the website via Dropbox, and kept in sync with the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/tree/main/docs">FeedLand Support repo</a> on GitHub. I had initially planned it to go first to the repo, and have the site be a dynamic rendering of the content in the repo, but there were rate limits that I didn't fully understand, and rather than stop to figure it out, I went the other way, which I know works, because I've been using it for many years.

The actual site that users will see is:  <a href="http://docs2.feedland.org/">docs2.feedland.org</a>.  

### Updates

Caveat

* This repo is private for now, while we get it together. 

* I don't want it to be private for very long. 

* Be aware that anything you post here will be public. 

The new workflow for the FeedLand docs.

* The pages have been converted to Markdown from HTML. 

* They are stored in the docs folder here on the A8C-FeedLand-Support repo. 

* This is the <a href="https://docs.feedland.dev/">docs website</a>, which simply mirrors the docs folder, rendered through a template. 

* You can <a href="https://github.com/scripting/a8c-FeedLand-Support/issues">report problems</a> with the docs, or post a pull request, in the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/a8c-FeedLand-Support/tree/main/docs">docs folder</a> on

Notes

* The docs website is at a temporary URL. I'm hosting it, but expect it to eventually be hosted on an Automattic server. The server is configured to serve out of the docs folder. 

* When changes are merged, they are instantly available on the website.

* Here's the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/code/feedland/docswebsite/markdowntemplate.txt">template</a> it uses. (I will move this into the repo too.) 

* I designed this flow guessing this is fairly close to the way A8C manages its docs.

* I edit the whole site in a single outline in Electric Drummer using a tool called Glorp. 

* The outline will be stored in the repo too.

This is just a test to see if the CMS is working.

All the non-developer docs are reviewed and in the new Markdown-based format. 

To see the list, look through the menu, at the top of the page.   

Soon they will be in the repo, had to change the way the text flowed, posting directly to GitHub has once again proved not dependable, though more problems were fixed this time around. Eventually we'll get this working properly.
